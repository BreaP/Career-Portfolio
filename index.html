        <h3>The Institute</h3>
        <p><em>Stephen King</em></p>
        <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> This is the first book I have ever read of Stephen King.
            The world he created in the story made the supernatural aspects
        of the story more realistice as if it was something that happens in the
    real world. The emotions in the book are perfectly reflected in the characters 
    and it was definitely a story I couldn't put down until I completed it. </p>
